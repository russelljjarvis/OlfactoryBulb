In this version of LFPsim, the ion channel distribution density and size of the individual compaertments was considered in the LFP calculation.

LFPsim - Simulation scripts to compute Local Field Potentials (LFP)
from cable compartmental models of neurons and networks implemented in
NEURON simulation environment.

LFPsim works reliably on biophysically detailed multi-compartmental
neurons with ion channels in some or all compartments.

How to run LFPsim
=================

1. Copy all LFPsim files and the directory into your NEURON model
directory downloaded from ModelDB. Copy lfp.mod and mea.mod from
LFPsim to the mechanism directory of the NEURON model.

2. Compile the model; if you had already compiled the model without
LFPsim, include the LFPsim mod files and re-compile using "nrnivmodl"
or "mknrndll".

3. Load your neuron or network model in NEURON.

4. On the terminal type: xopen("extracellular_electrode.hoc") to
initiate LFPsim GUI interface.

5. Set the electrode properties in the GUI.

6. Run the simulation to reconstruct LFP.

A detailed step-by-step procedure is also listed in the
How-To-LFPsim.pdf document.
